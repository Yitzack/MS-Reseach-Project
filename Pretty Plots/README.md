# Pretty Plots

These are the Mathematica scripts to create a sample of the plots. You will need to extend the plots to add several tempratures to the same plot or to add potentials to the same GraphicsGrid. You will need to point the Import directives where you store your data files. You should also add the appropriate Export directives so that the plots land where you need them. Othrerwise, both are ready to execute, either as a Mathematica notebook or a Mathematica script using the bash command `math -script Plots.m`

The *.m are here so you might be able to read the script without Mathematica. Again, the write-only nature of Mathematica applies again in several places.
